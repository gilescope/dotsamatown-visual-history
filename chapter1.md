## Chapter 1: Genesis

In the beginning there was a block hash on each block:
![block hash](chapter1/Screenshot%20from%202022-04-20%2012-13-27.png)

then I found some events so each block has some events on and the different lanes are different parachains:

Let's turn that up to 11 and see more parachains at once:

Some of them are overflowing their block. Time to make a block stack:

Ok let's space the blocks out based on when they got validated on the relay chain:

Let's color the events based on what pallet and variant they are:

Colors look a bit better near the light - might want to have some ambient lighting.

Let's put the boring extrinsics underneath the world. This is things that are required by the parachain to opperate but are not really user activity.

First attempt at on screen text, and started raining extrinsics and events from the heavens.

Highlighting XCM messages by having them go into the sky high:

EVM chains have distinctive patterns at the moment. I will need to understad how to use the eth abi to decode them. We're using cubes to display extrinsics (transactions) and the sphears are events.

Things don't always go to plan but at least some of the bugs are interesting!

So at the end of chapter 1 we have the start of something interesting.
