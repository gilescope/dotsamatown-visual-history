## Chapter 2: Rainbows

Let there be images! Let's show which parachain is which.

But maybe better on the floor

Let's repeat them so people don't have to refer back to the start

Statemine has a special place as one of the common good parachains:

Let's be able to click anything and get details on it:

Here's statemine getting upgraded. Alas the subscription kicked me off so I need 
to add some reconnect logic.

This could well be the first teleport on polkadot:

Teleports and reserve asset transfers are really cool but we need some way to show just how cool the technology is. Let's represent them as rainbows, or initially as a red line:

Rainbow Take 2: Get the shape right on the Y axis:

And now adding in all the colors of the rainbow:

Flick some flags and it's starting to look good most of the time:

Rainbow from up above:

Two rainbows (reserve asset transfers):

Lots of rainbows (many reserve asset transfers):

Ground level shot:

Donuts (don't ask me why) are used to show XCM events. I can't quite marry up all the events yet so some rainbows will have to wait. You still get the donuts at each end though.

So XCM is now visualised a bit and cross chain is looking pretty.
